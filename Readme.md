## Discord Plugins

To incorporate plugins into Discord, you'll require a client modification that supports plugin loading.

All plugins undergo testing with the [Dorion client](https://spikehd.github.io/projects/dorion/).

⚠️ **Please note:** Using a client modification like Dorion goes against Discord's terms of service.

To install a plugin with Dorion, follow these steps:

1. Open Dorion.
2. Navigate to the Discord settings.
3. Access the plugins setting within the Dorion settings category.
4. Click on "Open plugins folder."
5. Place the downloaded plugin into the opened plugins folder.
6. Restart Dorion if the plugin isn't visible.
7. Once the plugin is displayed, enable it and enable preload if necessary.
